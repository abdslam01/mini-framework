=> composer init
    then add to composer.json
        "autoload": {
            "psr-4": {
                "App\\": "app/",
                "": "core/"
            },
            "files": ["route/route.php"]
        }
=> composer dump-autoload (each time you update the composer.json file)

=> then to add Elequent (Illuminate/database)
we add to composer.json
    "require": {
        "illuminate/database": "^8.55",
        "illuminate/events": "^8.55"
    }
    "files": [
            "route/route.php",
            "database/config.php"
    ]
then: composer update

=> Add console command (only on command till now)
change composer.json to be like:
    "require": {
        "illuminate/database": "^8.55",
        "symfony/console": "^5.3"
    },
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "App\\": "app/",
            "": "core/",
            "MyConsole\\": "console"
        },
        "files": [
            "route/route.php",
            "database/config.php"
        ]
    }
the only supported commands till now is:
    php cmd make:controller folder1.folder2.NameController
    php cmd make:model folder1.folder2.NameModel

N o t e:
    Rebase The Project Structure:
        - Make All Related Files To Developpement Of The FrameWork On "Core" Folder:
            * to make it reusable in future project
            * ability to use it as a dependency in future project
        - Other Folder Will Remain And Must Be Modified In Developpement Process Of WebApps (Not FrameWork Developpement)
